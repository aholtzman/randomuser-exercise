Assignment:

Write a small application using JavaScript which parses and displays data from a public API. The application should run in and display its output in a web browser and should generate no errors. Feel free to utilize various JS libraries and utilities to complete the task.

Public API: https://randomuser.me

Requirements:
Making a single call to the randomuser.me API, get 20 random users.
Do not make additional calls to the API.
Users in the result set should be from the United States or Canada.
Display the following fields for each user:
Gender
First name
Last name
Country
Date of birth

Create and display an additional “Birthday” field whose value is dynamically calculated.

The value should identify if the user’s birthday: a) already happened, b) is today(!), or c) has yet to occur, based on today’s date for the current year.

Create a public GitHub or Bitbucket repository to host your application code, and share its URL for review.
